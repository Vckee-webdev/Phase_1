The program emphasizes real-time coding, collaborative problem-solving, and practical implementation of concepts. It has boosted my confidence in full-stack development, improved my debugging and deployment skills, and prepared me to take on real-world web development projects with a solid understanding of how all layers of a modern web application interact."
